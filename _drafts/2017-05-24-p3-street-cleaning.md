## What is OpenStreetMap?

Before we start working with the data I believe a small introduction to the
OpenStreetMap(OSM) project is in its place. The following is a short summary
from the [OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners_Guide_1.3).

The data consists of five different types of elements and each element can have
tags attached to it describing what that element is. The five element types are:

* *Node:* Nodes are dots used to that mark locations. Nodes can be seperate or can be connected.  
* *Way:* Ways are a connected line of nodes. It is used to create roads, paths, rivers, and so on.  
* *Closed way:* Closed ways are ways that form a closed loop. Usually forms an area.  
* *Area:* Areas are closed ways which are also filled. An area is usually implicitly implied when making a closed way.  
* *Relation:* Relation can be used to create more complex shapes, or to represent elements that are related but not physically connected. We won't get into this now. See the "advanced topics" section for more info.
