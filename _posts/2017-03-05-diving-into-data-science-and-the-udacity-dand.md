I have been thinking about starting a blog for some time but I never 
knew what to write about. So when I decided to enroll in the 
[Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)
from Udacity I thought it might be a good opportunity blog about it as well.

I wont go into the details for why I wanted to start studying data science in the
first place, but from the many different online alternatives out there I felt 
that the Udacity Nanodegree offered the best mix between statistics, programming 
(in both python **and** R), and project based assignements I could showcase to 
a prospective employer. Actually the courses included in the 
nanodegree is all optional and given you already have the expertise you could 
finish the whole program without completing a single lesson.

At the time of writing there are one optional and seven mandatory projects included in the nanodegree, listed below.

* **P0, Analyse Bay Area Bike Share Data** (Optional intro to the data analysis 
workflow and [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org))
* **P1, Test a Percaptual Phenomenon** (Statistical testing and drawing conclusions based on data)
* **P2, Investigate a Dataset** (Using numpy and pandas to answer questions 
with data)
* **P3, Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data** (Munge and clean up OpenStreetMap data 
for a part of the world you care about)
* **P4, Explore and Summarize Data** (Apply exploratory data analysis techniques 
on a selected dataset using R)
* **P5, Identify Fraud from Enron Email** (Use machine learning to identify possible 
fraud with emails and finacial data)
* **P6, Make effective Data Visualization** (Create data visualizations according 
to current best practices with dimple.js or d3.js)
* **P7, Design an A/B Test** (Design and analyze an A/B test in order to find 
improvements for a website)

For anyone interested to know more about the contents all the course material 
and project descriptions are accessible free of charge. However, you will not be 
able to send in your project for evaluation without a paying for the nanodegree.

At the moment I have only finished the first optional introductory project to get 
a feeling for the whole project submission process, but my experience so far has 
been really good. Submitting my project in the evening the day before, I recieved 
feedback already the next day.

The contents wasn't much to talk about, which is to be expected from an 
introduction, but the next project already looks promising. I will try to keep 
updating this blog with the results from each project and anything else I learn 
on the way that I might find worth sharing.
