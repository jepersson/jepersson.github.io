I have been thinking about starting a blog for some time but I never knew what
to write about. So when I decided to enroll in the [Data Analyst
Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) from
Udacity I thought it might be a good opportunity to start a blog as well.

I won't go into the details here on why I'm starting to study data science, but
among the different online alternatives I looked at, I felt that the Udacity
Nanodegree offered the best mix between statistics, programming (in both python
**and** R), and project based assignments. I believe that after completing this
nanodegree I will have a good foundation for a portfolio with data science
related projects.

At the time of writing there are one optional and seven mandatory projects
included in the nanodegree (See below).

* **P0, Analyse Bay Area Bike Share Data** (Optional intro to the data analysis
  workflow and [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org))
* **P1, Test a Perceptual Phenomenon** (Statistical tests and drawing
  conclusions based on data)
* **P2, Investigate a Dataset** (Using numpy and pandas to answer questions
  with and about datasets)
* **P3, Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data** (Munge and clean up OpenStreetMap data for
  a part of the world you care about)
* **P4, Explore and Summarize Data** (Apply exploratory data analysis
  techniques on a selected dataset using R)
* **P5, Identify Fraud from Enron Email** (Use machine learning to identify
  possible fraud with emails and financial data)
* **P6, Make effective Data Visualization** (Create data visualizations
  according to current best practices with dimple.js or d3.js)
* **P7, Design an A/B Test** (Design and analyze an A/B test in order to find
  improvements for a website)

For anyone interested to know more about the contents all the course material
and project descriptions are accessible free of charge. However, you will not
be able to send in your project for evaluation without paying.

At the moment I have only finished the first introductory project to get a
feeling for the whole submission process, but my experience so far has been
good. Submitting my project in the evening the day before, I received feedback
already during the next day and the feedback received really helped up my
motivation.

The contents isn't much to talk about, which is to be expected from an
introduction, but the next project looks promising. I will continue to update
this blog with my results from each of the projects and anything else I might
learn on the way that is worth sharing.
