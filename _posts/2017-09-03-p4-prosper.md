*This will be the fourth project and fifth post from my ongoing Nanodegree in
Data Analysis. This posts format will be a bit different since the report for
this project were initially written in R-markdown using Rstudio and then
converted into markdown before getting published so the formatting might look a
bit different from time to time. The way it is written is also a bit different
since it is more or less using a stream of consciousness to depict my thought
process while exploring the choosen data set. This means that except for the
resulting graphs and reflections in the end this post might be a bit wordy since
it is mostly unedited but I hope you will be able to bear with me.*

For this exploratory data analysis we are having a look at loan listings data
from a web service called [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com) to try to figure
out who are using the service, why they are taking a loan, and how much that
loan costs. Since the original data set contains over 80 variables I have picked
out a subset which we will use for our analysis loosely based on the above
stated questions. Initially some light data wrangling was also made to either
make the data set more readable and to handle NA values.

========================

Let's start by having a look at the summary statistics for the data to see what
we have to work with.

Based on the above numerical data our typical loan taker is a first time prosper
user with equal possibility to be a homeowner as not, taking a loan over 36 to
40 months with an interest rate of around 19%. The typical size of a loan is
\$6500. Next we plot the numbers of occurrences for the nominal variables in our
data set.

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Univariate_Plots_2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Univariate_Plots_2-2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Univariate_Plots_2-6.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

From the above plots we can see that most of the loan takers are employed but
the type of occupation is seldom given with the vague "Professional" and "Other"
occupation types both being in the top ten. A majority of loans are still being
repaid but there are also an substantial amount of past due, defaulted or
charged-off loans. 

Further, the income range looks to be fairly normalized with
an expected value somewhere around \$50,000. Lastly, we have the listing
categories for the loan listings and we can see that roughly half of the
reasons given for the loans through prosper is debt consolidation followed by
the once again rather vague "Not Available" and "Other" categories in the top
three. 

Now, after have gone through and had an initial look at all the variables
in the data set let's revisit and plot some of the more interesting numerical
variables to see how they are distributed over time.

<span class="tex2jax_ignore">
By plotting the above values we discovered some interesting facts such as that
the loan term probably are locked at one, three or five years. We also saw that
the usual amounts being borrowed are grouped around even \$5000 numbers with a
maximum at \$35000. Lastly, the loan origination dates clearly shows effects from
the 2008 recession and also an peak in new loans later years which we still
aren't able to explain.
</span>

Let's proceed with going over our findings once more before investigating
inter-variable relations in the bivariate section.

Univariate Analysis
===================

*What is the structure of your dataset?*

The original data set contains more variables than what we could practically
cover in one go, so to narrow them down we posed some questions about the data.
Let's revisit these questions to see if we made any discoveries worth noting
already.

First, to see who is using the service we can look at the following variables
mentioned:

-   Employment Status
-   Occupations
-   Income Ranges
-   IsBorrowerHomeowner
-   etc.

<span class="tex2jax_ignore">
Based on the summary data and plots presented, our typical loan taker is
employed, with an unspecified occupation, and probably an income of \$25,000 to
\$50,000. He/she is currently an homeowner and have debts of about a ratio of
0.22 of their income.
</span>

The reason for the loan is most likely debt consolidation with home improvement
and business lying as distant seconds among the specified reasons as seen in the
histogram with ranked listing categories.

To see what eventually happened with the loan we can have a look at the loan
status bin plot giving an overview over the different statuses for all the loans
in the data set. Out of a little over 100,000 loan listings we have a little
over 10,000 that have been defaulted or charged-off(&gt; 150 days overdue with
no reasonable expectation of sufficient payment).

*What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset? What other
features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into
your feature(s) of interest?*

Loan origination dates vs. closed dates together with the data on overdue,
defaulted, or charged-off loans. Using these features together with the above
calculated active loans variable it would be interesting to dive deeper and see
how, and when, the 2008 recession affected the loans taken.

Another features worth looking in to is the borrower rates which mostly pikes my
interest due to the unclear form of the distribution. Investigating what
variables are correlated and how they affect this blob of values centered
somewhere around 0.2 would be very interesting and perhaps a good candidate for
analysis by creating a regression model.

*Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?*

Using the Loan origination dates together with the closing dates I calculated a
new variable called active listings to show the volume of current loans on the
service. The calculation where made by taking the difference between originated
and closed loans for each date during a period between 2005 and 2014 and the
calculate the cumulative sum of those differences.

*Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions?  Did
you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of
the data? If so, why did you do this?*

In addition to make sure that all variables were read in using the correct data
type, I also choose how to handle NA values. For NA values for nominal data was
substituted with an preexisting category being best suited to improve the
readability of following histograms. Numeral values where set to 0 for ordinal
variables where NAs where present this in order to ease calculations in the
analysis while not influencing other statistical measures.

Bivariate Plots Section
=======================

To continue follow our interesting findings regarding the effects of the 2008
recession on active loan volumes let's plot the change in loan statuses and
listing categories for the period.

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Bivariate_Plots_1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Bivariate_Plots_1-2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

First, we can see that there have been some change in the gathering of the data
in the shift between 2007 and 2008. Looking at loan statuses we can see that the
ratio for Chargedoff and Defaulted loans did shift sharply with the amount of
Chargedoff loans skyrocketing. Analogously, the listing categories went from
mostly Not available to a mix of all different categories at the same period.

Looking at some of the numerical values in our data set we unfortunately cannot
see any meaningful correlation between variables, except for the connection
between monthly payments and the original amount of the loan.

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Bivariate_Plots_2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Following our slight drawback from analyzing the continuous variables we instead
focus on the categorical ones. Here we can start to see some slight trends in
the relationships between all our supporting variables and the borrower rate,
however not one single variable seems significant enough to draw any
conclusions.

Bivariate Analysis
==================

*Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in
the data set?*

We first had a look at the ratios for loan statuses and listing categories to
see if we could see any effects from the 2008 depression in our data other than
the decrease in the volume of loans. In the loan status data we could see an
increase in the part of loans being defaulted or Chargedoff followed by a
decrease in ratio when the economy recovered. For the listing categories we saw
that the biggest category has been and continues to be debt consolidation,
except for the obvious gaps in the data during 2008 there doesn't seem to have
been any greater impacts on the types of loans taken through prosper during or
after the time of 2008.

Turning our focus towards the borrower rate for loans I split up the
visualizations into two steps depending on if the supporting variables were of a
categorical or continuous type. First looking at the continuous variables we can
see that the original amount of the loan, together with the size of the monthly
payments and number of loan givers affect the borrower positively when
increasing, there is a negative correlation meaning that an increase in either
variable is connected with an decrease in the borrower rate for the loan. The
only variable we focus on that increases the borrower rate is the debt to income
ratio which shows an slightly positive correlation.

It is worth mentioning that none of the above relations did show any stronger
correlation all having a ratio below 0.5.

For the categorical variables all of them pointed to correlations between the
borrower rate and income, home ownership, term, occupation, and category of the
loan. It would definitely be interesting to pursue the analysis of the
correlation between borrower rates and these different variables further in the
following multivariate section.

*Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not
the main feature(s) of interest)? What was the strongest relationship you
found?*

The only really strong relationship I could find in the above analysis were the
relation between the original amount of the loan and monthly payments. This does
seem a bit trivial, since you could come to this conclusion without any
statistical analysis at all but it could be worth mentioning.

Multivariate Plots Section
==========================

First we take a look at the loan original amount and borrower rate in relation
to income range, term, debt to income ratio, and if the borrower is a homeowner
or not.

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Multivariate_Plots_1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Next we have a look at Borrower rates vs loan original amount with color coding
for some different secondary variables.

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Multivariate_Plots_2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Multivariate_Plots_2-2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Multivariate Analysis
=====================

*Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of
looking at your feature(s) of interest? Were there any interesting or surprising
interactions between features?*

From the group of scatter plots in this section we can see that the borrower
rate for a given loan amount increases together with an longer term loan and
also with the borrower's debt to income ratio. We can see this since for any
given value of loan amount the color is getting darker the further to the right
we move. The inverse is also true for the borrower income range which shows that
the borrower rate is generally lower for higher income borrowers given the same
loan amount. Lastly, we have the year of origin which does not show any similar
patterns, but instead there is a step change in the minimum loan amount and
maximum borrower rate. This is most likely due to a policy change at prosper
taking place somewhere 2007-2008.

<span class="tex2jax_ignore">
Moving on to the density plots we can see some interesting observations in the
plot comparing borrower rate and income ranges. The not employed status is in
general generating the worst borrower rate but surprisingly, not displaying
anything at all is better and comparable to the lowest income range bracket.
Something even more surprising is that \$0 income shares roughly the same shape
as income ranges from \$50000 and upwards.
</span>

Looking at the borrower rate density for loan terms we can see that shorter term
loans do get lower borrower rates but that there is a turning point somewhere
after 36 months where the uncertainty from a longer term length take the
overhand over other factors deciding the borrower rate. This can be seen in the
lower variance for loans with terms up to 60 months.

The debt to income ratio's density is neatly sorted in an expected order with
unreported and high ratios having peaks around 0.3 in borrower rates and lower
rates having peaks between 0.2 and 0.1. The only thing standing out is that the
fourth quartile (0.32, 10\] almost has two equally high peaks at both 0.2 and
0.3. I believe this might be stemming from the fact that this span is the
longest of the four quartiles. Most likely the distribution for the lower and
upper half of this quartile has different distributions. (The fact that values
over 10 is all clumped together at this value is also definitely a factor.)

The last graph, showing the rates divided by home owner or not has start out
with as we might expect with homeowner density being higher at lower interest
rate than non homeowner later switching to non homeowners being on top for
borrower rates just before hitting the 0.2 rate mark. Interesting to see however
was that at higher rates, 0.3 and above, being a homeowner or not does not seem
to affect the rate at all. Perhaps loan-takers given these kind of rates has
some other circumstances overshadowing the potential extra security being a
homeowner could bring.

*Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and
limitations of your model.*

My initial plan was to try create a linear model to predict borrower rates based
on the variables I had choose from the data set but going through the analysis
up until now I do not feel that I have been able to find enough data to make a
decision regarding what would constitute a suitable model. Rather than trying to
do anything based of loosely based assumption I will leave modelling for another
time.

Final Plots and Summary
=======================

*Plot One*

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Plot_One-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

*Description One*

The first plot depicts the monthly deltas for active loan listings. The reason I
choose this is due to how clear the effect from the 2008 recession can be seen.
Not only did the increase of loans take a deep dive in the early half of 2008
but the number of loans actually decreased pretty much all the way into 2011. I
don't think any deeper conclusions can be drawn from this graph but it might be
a good observation of how the market has looked like coming into the 2010's.

*Plot Two*

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Plot_Two-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

*Description Two*

The second graph I choose was the density curve for borrower rates colored by
term length. The reason for this is how the figure expresses the effect future
insecurity has on decisions today. The variance is high for both 12 and 36 month
loans but when the term increases further up to 60 months it shrinks. It is as
if the insecurity of the future makes the borrowers decision for the borrower
rate more uniform since there is less individual data they can count with.

I can also add that unlike the other two graphs, which I can image that I could
have come up with even before taking the Udacity EDA course, this graph was
something new I hadn't seen, or perhaps paid attention to, during my years at
university.

*Plot Three*

<img src="/img/2017-09-03-Plot_Three-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

*Description Three*

The third graph, and this might be cheating, is actually a combination of the
four different graphs depicting borrower rates vs loan original amounts with
different coloring for the distribution of income range, origination date, debt
to income ratio, and term for the loans plotted. Even though there weren't any
major breakthrough due to this figure this time, it do show that by trying
combination after combination of different variables patterns are eventually
found and sometimes you stumble over something unexpected. (In this case the
origination date graph with a weird pattern.)

Reflection
==========

This being the first time I had familiarized myself with R and Rstudio I do
think that the analysis might have been suffering from time to time while
focusing on how to use the tools rather than on what I was doing. Excuses aside,
it was however a really interesting and fun exploration into the world of p2p
lending.

I believe somewhere halfway through I did realize that trying to answer both
questions regarding the lenders and the loans with less than 20 variables were
harder than I first thought. Rather than trying to answer too much it might have
been better to focus on just one of those two aspects since the amount of
information need to fully explore just one aspect were more than I first had
thought.

I definitely think that going back and look at the prosper rating and a few more
financial variables can result in a more in depth analysis of what drives the
rating. It would also be a good candidate for creating a model to fit to the
