# About

Originally from Sweden I currently work as a system engineer and project leader
in Japan. When I'm not working I enjoy exploring Tokyo with surroundings, drink
coffee and keeping my brain cells fresh with code.

This blog started as a way to showcase projects from the Nanodegree in Data
Analysis I'm currently undertaking at Udacity and to give the presentation a bit
more personal feel than just a standard GitHub user page. However, I plan to
keep posting even after graduating from the program since this is just the
beginning of my pursuit to find new interesting things to explore in the world
of data.

I hope that you can find something you enjoy or have use for here. Since I
haven't decided on any theme, the posts might be a bit all over the place at
first but I am expecting a common theme to crystalize as the volume of contents
increases.

Except for this blog, I express my unfinished thoughts on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jepersson), brag about my accomplishments on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jericpersson/), and showcase my code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jepersson).
